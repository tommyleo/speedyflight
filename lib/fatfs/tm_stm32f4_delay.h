 *
 * Version 2.2
 *	- January 12, 2015
 *	- Added support for custom function call each time 1ms interrupt happen
 *	- Function is called TM_DELAY_1msHandler(void), with __weak parameter
 *	- attributes.h file needed
 *
 * ------!!!!!!!!!!!------
 *	If you are using GCC (sucks) compiler, then your delay is probably totally inaccurate.
 *	USE TIMER FOR DELAY, otherwise your delay will not be accurate
 *
 *	Or use ARM compiler!
 * ------!!!!!!!!!!!------
 *
 * Version 2.1
 *	- GCC compiler fixes
 *	- Still prefer that you use TIM for delay if you are working with ARM-GCC compiler
 *
 * Version 2.0
 *	- November 28, 2014
 *	- Delay library has been totally rewritten. Because Systick is designed to be used
 *	  in RTOS, it is not compatible to use it at the 2 places at the same time.
 *	  For that purpose, library has been rewritten.
 *	- Read full documentation below
 *
 * As of version 2.0 you have now to possible ways to make a delay.
 * The first (and default) is Systick timer. It makes interrupts every 1ms.
 * If you want delay in "us" accuracy, there is simple pooling (variable) mode.
 *
 * The second (better) options is to use one of timers on F4xx MCU.
 * Timer also makes an interrupts every 1ms (for count time) instead of 1us as it was before.
 * For "us" delay, timer's counter is used to count ticks. It makes a new tick each "us".
 * Not all MCUs have all possible timers, so this lib has been designed that you select your own.
 *
 * By default, Systick timer is used for delay. If you want your custom timer,
 * open defines.h file, add lines below and edit for your needs:
 *
 *	//Select custom timer for delay, here is TIM2 selected.
 *	//If you want custom TIMx, just replace number "2" for your TIM's number.
 *	#define TM_DELAY_TIM				TIM2
 *	#define TM_DELAY_TIM_IRQ			TIM2_IRQn
 *	#define TM_DELAY_TIM_IRQ_HANDLER	TIM2_IRQHandler
 *
 * With this setting (using custom timer) you have better accuracy in "us" delay.
 * Also, you have to know, that if you want to use timer for delay, you have to include additional files:
 *
 *	- CMSIS:
 *		- STM32F4xx TIM
 *		- MISC
 *	- TM:
 *		TM TIMER PROPERTIES
 *
 * Delay functions (Delay, Delayms) are now Inline functions.
 * This allows faster execution and more accurate delay.
 *
 * If you are working with Keil uVision and you are using Systick for delay,
 * then set KEIL_IDE define in options for project:
 *	- Open "Options for target"
 *	- Tab "C/C++"
 *	- Under "Define" add "KEIL_IDE", without quotes
